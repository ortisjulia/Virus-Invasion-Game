# Virus-Invasion-Game
Virus Invasion is a game created using PyGame that consists on shooting vaccines at the viruses that are trying to infect a scientist. This was a project part of the BINP16 course (Master in Bioinformatics at Lund University). 

## Code
This code was developed using Python3 version 3.8 using Spyder version 4.2.3, which is a Python development environment. Spyder can be downloaded using the cross-platform Anaconda distribution.

### Anaconda
In order to download Anaconda and, therefore, Spyder, you can go to the Anaconda website and follow their [installation protocol](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

### Python Modules
Before using this script it is recommended to install the following Python modules:

**1. PyGame:** to develop the game. For more information check out their [website](https://www.pygame.org/news). In orde to install it you can use `pip install pygame`.

**2. mixer:** this module contains classes for loading Sound objects and controlling playback. The mixer module is optional and depends on `SDL_mixer`. Your program should test that `pygame.mixer` module for loading and playing sounds is available and initialized before using it.

### Usage
This script can be run from the command line by using the following command: `python VirusInvasion.py`. It can also be run from any Python development environment such as Spyder.

All the files needed to run the game can be found in the folder called Files_For_VirusInvasion. The only file missing is intr2.wav as it is too big to be uploaded. Nevertheless, any music file can be used instead of it. Just make sure to put it in the same folder as `VirusInvasion.py` and to change the name of the file so it matches the name in the code.

### Example output

An example of the output of my script can be found under the name VirusInvasionOUTPUT.mp4.
